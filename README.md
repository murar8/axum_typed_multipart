Helper library for the [axum framework](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) designed to allow you to parse the `multipart/form-data` body of the supplied request into an arbitrary struct.

## Documentation

Documentation and installation instructions are available on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/axum_typed_multipart)

## Release process

When a [SemVer](https://semver.org/) compatible git tag is pushed to the repo a new version of the package will be published to [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/axum_typed_multipart).

## Contributing

Direct push to the `main` branch is not allowed, any updates require a pull request to be opened. After all status checks pass the PR will be eligible for review and merge.

Commit messages should follow the [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) specification.

## Improvements

- Allow populating optional fields using the `std::default::Default` implementation for the type.
- Allow for setting an arbitrary default value for optional fields.
